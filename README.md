# password-manager

This is backend application, in which the user can create multiple accounts for his/her organization/ instituion or just for own purposes.
The user password undergoes a security test to detect the easily guessable passwords and suggests to change it.
This user can create a new account with a password, and save all the passwords wrt to thier services.
The passwords are strongy encrypted with my own new algorithm.
All the data regarding the user and the passwords are saved in mysql database
Users can also delete thier account by providing thier password to the prompt

For future update:
1. create user compatibility application
2. arrange for global database usage
3. create a secure application safe from sql-injections
4. Enhance user experience

Latest version to be used: password_db_user_ad_2.py 
Thank you
